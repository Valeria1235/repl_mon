repl_mon, custom bgworker for PostgreSQL
=========================================

Background worker which writes current timestamp, current xlog location and
number of streaming replics to a certain table every certain interval of time.

It is useful for monitoring replication of PostgreSQL instances:
 - in seconds, not only in bytes,
 - without the need to have superuser option for monitoring user.

This worker can use the following parameters:
 - repl_mon.interval, time (ms) between writing information to table, default is 1000, set 0 to disable updates.
 - repl_mon.table, name of the table to write data to, default is "repl_mon".

This worker is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.3 and newer versions.
